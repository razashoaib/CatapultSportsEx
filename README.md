## CatapultSportsEx [Laravel(v5.6) with React(v16.4.1)]

The goal of this project is to create an API and simple Front-end to demonstrate the CRUD operations using RESTful Web Services. The API is developed using Laravel Framework (v5.6) and the Front-end was developed using React (v16.4.1). Thus, this project is a perfect example to demonstrate that how can we use React with Laravel Framework.
